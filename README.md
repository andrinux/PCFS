# UserFS: A Userspace File System Implementation 


Not Only Reinvent the Wheels... 
Although it is what I am doing right now.

:)


## Project Goals
* Faster speed.
* Simpler & smaller footprint.
* Lower memory usage.
* Concurrent, in memory access.
* More on the way... :)

##Technology
It is pretty hard to debug a kernel space file system. So I decide to try a userspace one first and migrate it to kernel version.
